The long-awaited [review paper on continuum modelling of active suspensions](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2024.0251) is finally published in the themed issue [_Biological fluid dynamics: emerging directions_](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/toc/rsta/2025/383/2304) on Phil. Tran. Roc. Soc. A!
This was years of hard work summarising over decades long of research progress and experience in the field. 
It might also be the most concise derivation of (almost) all existing continuum models for active suspensions. (Brag!)
